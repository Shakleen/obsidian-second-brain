The standard recommendation from the American Dental Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is to brush for two minutes, twice a day, with a fluoride toothpaste.
- Fluoride is widely recognized as the single most effective agent for preventing tooth decay.
- After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, most dental organizations recommend to **"Spit, Don't Rinse"** with water for a period of time to maximize the fluoride's protective contact with the teeth.
- Brushing before bed is particularly important because saliva production falls at night. [ScienceDirect+1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653923009632?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
