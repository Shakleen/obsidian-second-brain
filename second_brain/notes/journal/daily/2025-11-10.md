# 2025-11-10

## Timeline
- 08:50AM: Couldn't wake up again. I'm starting to think I'm just being lazy. Anyway, had breakfast. Watched a few Style Theory episodes on 2X.
- 09:00AM: Noted what I learned from the Style Theory episodes in [[The Style Theorists – Is Conditioner ACTUALLY Good for Your Hair  Style Theory]] and [[The Style Theorists – $1 vs $300 Toothbrush  Style Theory]].
- 12:21PM: Talking to my counsel of LLMs about what I want to do my PhD in. I realized that my PhD goal was too broad. So I'm narrowing it down to very specific questions that I want to find answers for. This has led me to create [[What is my PhD research goal]]?
