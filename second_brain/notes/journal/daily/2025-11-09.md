# 2025-11-09

## Timeline
- 07:50AM: Woke up and did my morning routine. Woke up at 4AM but went straight back to sleep. Maybe this isn't gonna work out. I should just stick to waking up at Fajr instead. Haven't been able to pray Tahajjud at all. It's an optional prayer anyway. It's causing me to miss my fard prayers.
- 08:34AM: Created admission account for ASU. Filled in basic information and uploaded the educational transcripts.
- 09:29AM: Had breakfast with Wife. 
- 18:58PM: Got back from the movie **Daru Chini Dip**. Pretty good for a Bangla movie. A bit slow but the acting was really good. Hated the never ending songs.
- 21:30PM: Studied about proper showering and moisturizing routine. Got some product recommendations. Talked to Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude. Read a little bit on the research they cited.
