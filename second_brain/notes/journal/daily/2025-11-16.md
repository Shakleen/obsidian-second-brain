# 2025-11-16

## Timeline
- 05:00AM: Woke up for Fajr. Not gonna wake up at 4:00AM anymore. I need to get at least 7 hours of sleep. My body tires too much towards the end of the day.
- 06:28AM: Got back from Fajr, made coffee, saw a shooting star in the balcony with wifey.
- 08:30AM: Setup samsung health to be my new workout tracking app. Made a new workout program with sets, reps, and rest times. For now, I'm gonna see if I like using it for a week and then commit to it.
- 10:30AM: Sat down to revamp my resume. 
- 12:30PM: Resume revamp done. Mostly focused on my deep learning experience. Hopefully thats enough. Now I'm off to Duhr prayer. Then i gotta buy some groceries.
