# The Zettelkasten Method

[A Zettelkasten, then, means “note box”.][1]

## [4 note types][1]
1. **Fleeting**: In the moment thoughts and ideas
2. **Literature**: Capture the key points and ideas from the books, articles, or other sources that you're studying. Remember to keep each literature note a single idea, as opposed to a collection of learnings from what you read.
3. **Permanent**: These are the notes that you want to keep for the long-term. They’re made up of the notes you’ve grouped and connected together.
4. **Reference**: Think of them as the table of contents or legend that tell you where to find what information, or which notes connect with which.
