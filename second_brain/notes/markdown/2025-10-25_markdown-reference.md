# markdown reference

Supports reference-style links, where you define the URL separately and refer to it using a label. You can use numbers as these labels.
  ```markdown
  This is a [link to Google][1].
  This is another [link to example.com][2].

  [1]: https://www.google.com
  [2]: https://www.example.com
  ```
