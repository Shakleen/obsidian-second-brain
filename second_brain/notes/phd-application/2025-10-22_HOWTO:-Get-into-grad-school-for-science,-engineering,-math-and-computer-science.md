# HOWTO: Get into grad school for science, engineering, math and computer science

* When graduate schools are admitting students (M.S. or Ph.D.), they are trying to answer one question from your application materials: "Does this person have the potential to conduct scientific research?" 

## Personal Statement 

* Personal statements = "Why should we, the admissions committee, believe that you, the applicant, have the potential do research in field X?" and "What kind of research could you see yourself doing and why?"

* A really good "personal" statement will talk about projects you've worked on, any publications that resulted and include citations to relevant research articles from the field.

## 10 Application tips 

1. Contact a faculty member you'd like to work with.
  * Email them a month or so before you apply.
    > Comment intelligently on some research that faculty member has done. Attach any research you've done, and briefly summarize your research interests.
  * Send a short follow-up email in December/January so they remember to tell the admissions committee to watch for you! 
2. Be brief. Bold whatever's important.
3. Choose your area of interest/preferred faculty carefully.
