# 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen R. Covey is a principle-centered approach to personal and professional effectiveness.

The habits are divided into three stages:

1.  **Dependence to Independence (The Private Victory):** Focuses on self-mastery.
    * **Habit 1: Be Proactive** (Take responsibility for your life and choices.)
    * **Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind** (Define your values and goals; create a personal mission statement.)
    * **Habit 3: Put First Things First** (Prioritize tasks based on importance, not just urgency.)

2.  **Independence to Interdependence (The Public Victory):** Focuses on teamwork, communication, and collaboration.
    * **Habit 4: Think Win-Win** (Seek mutually beneficial solutions in all interactions.)
    * **Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood** (Practice empathetic listening.)
    * **Habit 6: Synergize** (Value differences and work together to find a solution that is greater than the sum of its parts.)

3.  **Continuous Improvement:**
    * **Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw** (Renew and enhance your physical, mental, spiritual, and social/emotional self to sustain effectiveness.)
