A famous hadith describes a person praying too quickly. Rifaa Ibnu Rafi narrates:
> _"When we were in the mosque, a man dressed like a Bedouin came._ He performed a prayer in a very brief manner. Then, he finished prayer and greeted the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). _The Messenger of Allah said_,
> 
> **"And upon you. Go back and perform prayer because you have not prayed."**
> 
> Thereupon, he returned to perform the prayer again; then, he came and greeted the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet answered his greeting and said,  
> 
> **"Go back and perform prayer because you have not prayed."**
> 
> The man did the same thing twice or thrice and the Prophet said the same thing:
> 
> **"Go back and perform prayer because you have not prayed."**
> 
> The people got scared and became very worried that one whose prayer was so brief had not been regarded to have prayed. Then, the man said:
> 
> “_I am a human being. I do what is right and I make mistakes. Show me my mistake and teach me._” The Prophet (pbuh) said,
> 
> **"'Alright. When you stand for prayer, perform wudu as Allah ordered you. Then, say shahadah (call adhan) and iqamah. If you know any verses of the Quran by heart, read it; if not, praise Allah, mention His greatness, and say la ilaha illallah.** **Then, bow down; when you are in ruku’, wait until your organs settle. Then stand completely and wait for a while. Then prostrate and wait in prostration until your organs settle. Then, sit for a while; after that, stand up.”**  
> 
> **“If you do like that, you will have completed your prayer perfectly. If you leave out something, you will have made your prayer deficient."**
> 
> The narrator said, _"This statement of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was easier and more relieving to the Companions than his previous statement_ **"Go back and perform prayer because you have not prayed."** _For, according to the last statement, there was something deficient in the prayer but it was not rejected completely."_
