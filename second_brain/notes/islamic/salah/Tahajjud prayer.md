## Time
Same time as [[2025-10-30_Isha-prayer|Isha prayer]], but should be performed after it. **The best time is to pray at the deep of night after waking from sleep.**
## [[Rakat|Rakats]]
* 8 [[Nafl]] [[Rakat|rakats]] prayed 2 [[Rakat|rakats]] at a time in groups of 4. Prophet (SA) used to take breaks after 4 [[Rakat|rakats]].
* However, this is an optional prayer. So the prayer can be as long or as short as you want. The shortest is 2 [[Rakat|rakats]].
## Importance
It is the most important of all optional prayers with a great deal of rewards promised.
## Process
1. Begin with 2 short [[Rakat|rakats]]. 
   - Abu Huraira (RA) reported that the Prophet (SA) said, when one of you get up from sleep for salat, let him begin with two short salat. (Muslim)
   - Ayesha (RA) reported that whenever the Prophet (SA) used to get up from sleep for salat, he used to begin with 2 short salats.
1. Then proceed to pray considering how much time and energy you have.
## Qaza
1. Hazrat Ayesha (RA) said, when Prophet (SA) used to miss Tahajjud for valid reasons, he would perform 12 additional [[Nafl]] [[Rakat|rakats]]. (Muslim)
2. Hazrat Omar Ibn Khattab (RA) said that the Prophet (SA) said, 
   > if any one goes to sleep without performing his/her usually performed optional salats or zekers, and he/she does perform those salats between Fajr and Duhr prayers, he/she gets the same virtues. (Muslim)
