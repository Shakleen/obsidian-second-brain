The prayer position one goes to from [[Shijda]] after hearing [[Takbir]].
## Position
1. Sit on top of left leg.
2. Have right leg be up right with the toes pointing to [[Qibla]].

However, maintaining this position is [[Sunnat-e-Ghair-Muakkadah|Sunnah]] and not [[Fard]]. If you're having difficulty maintaining this position, sit in whichever way you're comfortable. But make sure that your feet doesn't point in the direction of [[Qibla]].
