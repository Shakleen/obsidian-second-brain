## Placing [[Sutra]]
* It is [[Mustahab]] to place [[Sutra]] in front while praying, so that others may pass in front of you.
![[Fiqh of Placing a Barrier (sutra) In Front of One's Prayer Place   - I#^PlaceSutraHadith]]
* The [[Sutra]] can be as thin as a hair
![[Fiqh of Placing a Barrier (sutra) In Front of One's Prayer Place   - I#^SizeOfSutra]]
* If one can't find something to place then a line can be drawn

## Best way to avoid passing
* If you're sitting in front of the person praying, then stand up and leave by their side. ([[Fiqh of Placing a Barrier (sutra) In Front of One's Prayer Place   - I#^LeaveFromStanding|Source]])
* Pass beyond the point a [[Sutra]] is placed.
* If a [[Sutra]] isn't placed then pass beyond where a person would place his head on the ground for [[Shijda]]
