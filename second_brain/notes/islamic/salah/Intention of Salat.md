## Meaning
**Niyat** means determining intention to perform something.
## Process
Silently state the intention of Salah. This means saying what Salah you're about to perform. It doesn't have to be in Arabic. It can be in whatever language you're comfortable with. Here are a few examples:
## Praying Duhr in [[Jamat]]
> I'm standing behind this Imam, facing towards the Qibla, to perform 4 Fard rakats of Duhr.
## Praying [[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah|Sunnat]] rakats of Duhr alone
> I'm facing towards the Qibla and performing 4 Sunnat rakats of Duhr.

The important thing is to know what one is going to do. The determination of intent is the main factor. The words are there only to help perform this determination.
