Fiqh means understanding-specifically, understanding the rulings of Islam. It helps us distinguish between what is obligatory, what is allowed, and what is forbidden.

| **Rank** | **Term**                 | **English Meaning**    | **Consequence if Performed** | **Consequence if Omitted** | **Relation to Halal/Haram**            |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | **[[Fard]] / [[Wajib]]** | Obligatory             | Reward                       | **[[Major Sin]]**          | Outside the scope of general Halal     |
| **2**    | **[[Mustahab]]**         | Recommended            | Reward                       | None                       | **Halal** (Encouraged)                 |
| **3**    | **[[Mubah]]**            | Permissible / Neutral  | None                         | None                       | **Halal** (Permitted)                  |
| **4**    | **[[Makruh]]**           | Disliked / Discouraged | None (unless persistent)     | Minor Reward               | **Generally Halal** (But best avoided) |
| **5**    | **[[Haram]]**            | Forbidden / Prohibited | **[[Major Sin]]**            | Reward                     | Outside the scope of general Halal     |
In common usage, Halal often encompasses everything from [[Mustahab]] to [[Mubah]], while [[Haram]] is the clear prohibition, with [[Makruh]] being the area of caution in between.
