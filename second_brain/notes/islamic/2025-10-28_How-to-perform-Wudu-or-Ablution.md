>
> “Ashhadu alla ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lahu, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu. ”
> 
> “I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I also testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.”

### Step 12: Dua 
> اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي مِنَ التَّوَّابِينَ، وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ، وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنْ عِبَادِكَ الصَّالِحِينَ
>
> “Allahumma aj‘alni min at-tawwabeen, wa aj‘alni min al-mutatahhirin, waj’alni min ‘ibadik-as-salihin.”
>
> “O Allah, make me among those who seek repentance and make me among those who purify themselves.”
