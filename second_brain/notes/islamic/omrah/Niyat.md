The process of determining intention of doing something in Islam. Niyat can be done silently or out loud, spoken in arabic or in your language of choice. The important thing is that you intend to do something and know what exactly that something is. More specifically, if you intend to perform any kind of religious activity, you should be pure of heart and intend to do it for the purpose of pleasing Allah (Swt).
