1. **Don't argue with people from other [[Majhab|Majhabs]]**: Do what you need to do for [[Hajj]] or [[Omrah]] the way you were taught. Different [[Majhab|Majhabs]] do things differently, and one shouldn't argue over this.
2. Follow the teachings of your [[Majhab]]
3. **Don't look at women**: If you catch yourself doing so, look away immediately.
4. Don't perform [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]] in [[Jamat]] in the same row as women.
