Ijteba is a way to wear [[Ehram clothes]] for [[Tawaf-e-Omrah]].

Take the middle of your clothing, pass it below your right underarm, then cover your left shoulder with it. In this process, your right should will remain exposed.

## When
1. Only during Tawaf which has [[Sayi]].
2. Never anywhere else
