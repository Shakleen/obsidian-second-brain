## Process
1. [[Niyat]] for Sayi. ([[Mustahab]])
2. Go to Safa mountain.
3. Climb Safa mountain just enough <span style="color: red;">(never more)</span> such that *you can see [[Baytullah|Qaba]] through [[Babus Safa]] door*
	1. When you see the [[Baytullah|Qaba]] recite [[Dua while looking at Qaba]]
	2. Recite [[Durud]] silently
	3. Pray for yourself and others. (One of the places where dua is accepted)
4. Climb down from Safa and head towards Marwa mountain.
5. Climb up Marwa just like Safa, face [[Baytullah|Qaba]] and recite [[Dua while looking at Qaba]]
6. This completes 1 round of Sayi. 
	1. The 2nd round will be from Marwa to Safa.
	2. The 3rd from Safa to Marwa.
	3. And so on until 7 rounds ending at Marwa.
