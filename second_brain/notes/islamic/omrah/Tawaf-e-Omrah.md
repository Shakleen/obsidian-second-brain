## Process of getting into [[Masjidul Haram]]
* Enter through any door, but it is [[Mustahab]] to enter through **Babus Salam** or 24 number door.
* While entering recite [[Talbiya]] repeatedly.
* Pay attention to the [[#Sunnats of entering mosque]]
### Sunnats of entering mosque
* Take off shoes before entering the mosque.
	* If you're going to take the shoes with you, make sure they are clean.
	* First take off your left shoe, then right.
* Say [[Bismillah]] before entering.
* Recite [[Durud]] and [[Salam]].
* Perform [[Niyat]] for [[Nafl]] [[Itekaf]]
* If you look straight, you'll see [[Baytullah]]. 
	* Upon seeing it, immediately recite the following **3 times**:
	  > Allahu akbar la ilaha illallahu
	  > Allah is almighty and there is no god except Allah.
	* This is the time to perform whatever dua you want. It's one of the places where dua is accepted. 
## Process of Tawaf
1. Before starting, males should do [[Ijteba]]. ([[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah|Sunnat]])
2. Stop reciting [[Talbiya]]. Until your [[Ehram]] is done, don't recite it again.
3. Face [[Baytullah|Qaba]] keeping [[Hajre Aswad]] to your right shoulder.
4. [[Niyat]] for tawaf.
5. Afterwards, move to your right until [[Hajre Aswad]] is directly in front of you. 
	1. Raise your hands to your ears or shoulders
	2. Recite
	   > Bismillahi wallahu akbar, wa lillahil hamd, was' salatu was' salamu ala rasulillahi sallallahu ta'la alaihi wassallam
	   > I'm praying for help in the name of Allah (swt). Allah is the greatest. There is no god except for Allah. And durud and salam is for Allah's rasul.
	3. Lower your hands.
6. Now [[Kiss Hajre Aswad]].
7. Next, turn right, placing [[Baytullah|Qaba]] to your left, and begin Tawaf. 
    - Make sure your chest never faces [[Baytullah|Qaba]] while you walk. If it does for even a step or two, go back a few steps, and then continue.
    - When you reach [[Multajam]] recite the following dua:
	  > Allahumma enam bika wa tasdikam bitika, wa wafa'am bi'ahdika wa ittiba'an lisunnati nabiyika muhammadin sallallahu alaihi was'salam.
	  > O Allah! I am starting tawaf bring iman and belief in You, Your (holy) books, to carry out your commands, and to follow the example set by Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Was'salam.
