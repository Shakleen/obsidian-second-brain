## Process of getting into [[Masjidul Haram]]
* Enter through any door, but it is [[Mustahab]] to enter through **Babus Salam** or 24 number door.
* While entering recite [[Talbiya]] repeatedly.
* Pay attention to the [[#Sunnats of entering mosque]]
### Sunnats of entering mosque
* Take off shoes before entering the mosque.
	* If you're going to take the shoes with you, make sure they are clean.
	* First take off your left shoe, then right.
* Say [[Bismillah]] before entering.
* Recite [[Durud]] and [[Salam]].
* Perform [[Niyat]] for [[Nafl]] [[Itekaf]]
* If you look straight, you'll see [[Baytullah]]. 
	* Upon seeing it, immediately recite the following **3 times**:
	  > Allahu akbar la ilaha illallahu
	  > Allah is almighty and there is no god except Allah.
	* This is the time to perform whatever dua you want. It's one of the places where dua is accepted. 
## Process of Tawaf
1. Before starting, males should do [[Ijteba]]. ([[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah|Sunnat]])
2. Stop reciting [[Talbiya]]. Until your [[Ehram]] is done, don't recite it again.
3. Face [[Baytullah|Qaba]] keeping [[Hajre Aswad]] to your right shoulder.
4. [[Niyat]] for tawaf.
5. Afterwards, move to your right until [[Hajre Aswad]] is directly in front of you. 
6. Raise your hands to your ears or shoulders and recite
   > Bismillahi wallahu akbar, wa lillahil hamd, was' salatu was' salamu ala rasulillahi sallallahu ta'la alaihi wassallam
   > I'm praying for help in the name of Allah (swt). Allah is the greatest. There is no god except for Allah. And durud and salam is for Allah's rasul.
7. Then lower your hands.
8. Now, without bothering anyone, go in front of [[Hajre Aswad]] and kiss it without making a noise. The process of kissing is to place both hands on it and kiss in the middle of the hands. Make sure not to kiss the silver covering around the [[Hajre Aswad]].
	   - Kissing it 3 times is [[Mustahab]]
	   - After each kiss, keeping your forehead or cheek on it is also [[Mustahab]].
	   - In case you're unable to kiss it due to crowd, touch [[Hajre Aswad]] with your right hand, and then kiss that hand.
	   - If even that's not possible, then imitate you are placing your both hands on [[Hajre Aswad]] and then kiss both hands.
9. During this time, recite the following:
	> Bismillahi allahu akbar.
10. Next, turn right, placing [[Baytullah|Qaba]] to your left, and begin Tawaf. Make sure your chest never faces [[Baytullah|Qaba]] while you walk. If it does for even a step or two, go back a few steps, and then continue.
