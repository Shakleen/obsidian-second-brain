[[Hajj]] becomes [[Fard]] on one when the following applies:
1. One is [[Of Age|of age]]
2. One is able
   - Not blind
   - Not crippled in anyway
1. One has sufficient money to undertake [[Hajj]]: When one has extra money or resources after the absolute necessary amount of money to take care of the needs of oneself and one's family, that extra money or resources is considered **suffcient money**. Things that should be considered when making this calculation are:
	1. Income
	2. Savings
	3. Business assets
	4. Real estate
	5. Gold and other jewelry
2. If one is a female, then one must be accompanied by either her husband or a trusted [[Mahrum male]]. If she doesn't have this person, then she can have someone else do the [[Hajj]] for her.

## Delaying Hajj
1. Hazrat Ibn Abbas (RA) reported,
   > Prophet (SA) said, "When hajj becomes fard for someone, one should perform it as soon as possible". (Abu Dawood)
2. Hazrat Abu Umama (RA) reported,
   > When one doesn't perform Hajj without having an emergency or being blocked by a unruly king or being burdened by a terrible sickness, (When Hajj has become Fard on that person) and dies; then that person dies as a non-Muslim" (Darimi)
