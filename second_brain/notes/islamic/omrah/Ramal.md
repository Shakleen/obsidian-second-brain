## When
* It's [[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah|Sunnat]] to perform Ramal in the first 3 tawafs. 
* If you can't do it close because of crowd, do it far from the [[Baytullah|Qaba]].
* If you can't do it in the first round, do it in the 2nd and 3rd. 
* If you can't do it in the 1st and 2nd, then do it in the 3rd.
* If you can't do it in either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, then don't do it in the remaining 4th to 7th tawafs.

## Procedure
1. Keep chest high.
2. Move shoulders as if you're walking with bravery and confidence.
3. Place each step apart (not close) and walk with strength.
