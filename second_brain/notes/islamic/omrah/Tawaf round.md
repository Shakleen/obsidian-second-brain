## Process
![[Pasted image 20251115063529.png]]
- Starts from [[Hajre Aswad]] and move to [[Multajam]].
- When you reach [[Multajam]] recite the following dua:
  > Allahumma enam bika wa tasdikam bitika, wa wafa'am bi'ahdika wa ittiba'an lisunnati nabiyika muhammadin sallallahu alaihi was'salam.
  > O Allah! I am starting tawaf bring iman and belief in You, Your (holy) books, to carry out your commands, and to follow the example set by Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Was'salam.
- If it's the first 3 tawafs, then males should perform [[Ramal]]. ([[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah|Sunnat]]).
- Tawaf must be done outside of [[Hatim]]. ([[Wajib]])
- Without bothering anyone, it's best to perform tawaf as close to [[Baytullah|Qaba]] as possible.
- When reaching [[Rukun-e-iyamin]], touch it if possible. ([[Mustahab]]) <span style="color: red;">But don't kiss it or the hands that touch it. If not possible to touch, then don't imitate as if you're touching it.</span>
- Then recite the following dua, while going from [[Rukun-e-iyamin]] to [[Hajre Aswad]]:
  > Rabbana atina fid'duniya hasanatao, wafil akhirati hasanatao, wakina azabannar
  > O Allah, grant me blessings in this life and in the next life. And save me from the punishment in Jahannam.
