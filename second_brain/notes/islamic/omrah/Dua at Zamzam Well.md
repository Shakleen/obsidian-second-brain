Go to [[Zamzam]], drink water, and dua.  The dua is as follows:
> Allahumma inni as'aluka ilman nafi'ao wa rizkao wa'achiao wa shifa'am min kulli daiyin
> Meaning: O Allah, I want from You, helpful knowledge, great rijik, and freedom from all illnesses.

> [!Info] [[Mustahab]]
> 1. Drink water facing [[Baytullah|Qaba]]
> 2. To say the dua mentioned above.

> [!Warning] 
> It's mostly not possible to go near [[Zamzam]] well anymore. So drinking water near to it is good enough.
