Minor sins are wrongdoings that can be forgiven through:
1. [[Wudu|Wudu]] (ablution)
2. [[Fard Ghusl|Ghusl]] (shower)
3. [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salat]] (prayer)
4. Doing good deeds
5. Saying prescribed adhkar (remembrances)
However, consistent repetition of minor sins without repentance can eventually elevate them to major sins, especially if done shamelessly or with pride.
