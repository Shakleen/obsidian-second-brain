The second stance in [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]] which one goes from [[Qiyam]] position upon [[Takbir]].
## Going to Ruku
1. Sometimes Prophet (SA) used to raise his hands to his ears / shoulders upon hearing or saying [[Takbir]]. Sometimes he did not. Either way is fine.
2. Release your hands.
3. Slowly bow down until you get into [[#Position]].
## Position
* Bow down until your head is in the same line as your butt.
* Putting palms firmly on your knees.
* FIngers spaced out
* Hands away from sides
* Ramain until joints are at ease and relaxed
