# Forbidden prayer times
1. From dawn until the sun has risen to the height of a spear
2. When it is directly overhead at noon until it has passed its zenith
3. From ‘Asr prayer until the sun has set completely.

## Supporting Hadiths
1. This is indicated by the report narrated by **al-Bukhari** (547) and **Muslim** (1367) from Ibn ‘Abbas, who said:  
  > Some trustworthy men bore witness in my presence, the most trustworthy of whom in my view was ‘Umar, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade praying after Fajr until the sun had risen and after ‘Asr until the sun had set.” 
2. **Al-Bukhari** (548) and **Muslim** (1371) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: 
  > The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the top edge of the sun has risen, then delay praying until it has risen above the horizon, and when the lower part of the sun has set, delay praying until it is fully set.” 
3. **Al-Bukhari** (551) narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri said: 
  > I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no prayer after Fajr until the sun has risen fully, and no prayer after ‘Asr until the sun has set.” 
4. **Muslim** (1373) narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir al-Juhani said: 
  > “There are three times at which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to pray or to bury our dead: when the sun has clearly started to rise until it is fully risen, when it is directly overhead at midday until it has passed its zenith, and when the sun starts to set until it has fully set.”
