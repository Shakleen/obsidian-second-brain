These are severe actions that carry **major consequences**, sometimes **even legal punishments** in Islamic law.
## Examples
1. Shirk (associating partners with Allah)
2. Theft
3. Murder
4. Riba (usury)
5. Zina (fornication/adultery)
Major sins require true repentance, increased worship, and possibly returning rights to others (like stolen property).
