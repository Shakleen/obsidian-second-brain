# Sunnat e Muakkadah

## Level: Emphasized sunnat
**Meaning**: These are acts the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) performed **persistently** and **regularly** as part of his established practice (Sunnah).

## Consequence of Omission
While not equivalent to missing a [[Fard]] or [[Wajib]], consistently neglecting without a valid excuse is considered [[Makruh]] or sinful by many scholars (Hanafi).

## Example:
- 2 rakat sunnat prayer before [[Fard]] in [[2025-10-30_Fajr-prayer|Fajr]] 
- 4 rakat sunnat prayer before [[Fard]] in [[2025-10-30_Duhr-prayer|Duhr]]
- etc.
