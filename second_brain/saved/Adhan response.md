# Adhan response

Repeat [[Adhan]] sentences exactly as the Muazzen says except for sentences 4 and 5. For these say the following:

La hawla wala quata illa billa
> لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِالله
> There is no power to achieve good or might to avert evil except through Allah.

## Why
It is Sunnah to respond to Adhan.

* Abdullah Ibn Omar said that the Prophet (SA) said,
  >  “When you hear the Muazzen, say what he says, then ask a blessing for me. Whoever asks a blessing for me once, Allah will bless him ten times. Then ask Allah for his favour to me. He who asks Allah’s favour for me, for him will I intercede.” (Muslim)
* Prophet (SA) said, 
  > “When you hear the adhan, repeat what the muazzin says” (Bukhari)
