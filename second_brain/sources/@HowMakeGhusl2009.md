> As for the complete form, it is as follows

1.    Form the intention in the heart to purify oneself from major impurity: janabah (impurity following sexual discharge), menses or nifas (postpartum bleeding).

2.    Then say Bismillah and wash the hands three times, then wash any dirt from the private part.

3.    Then do wudu as for prayer, a complete wudu.

4.    Then pour water over the head three times, and rub the hair so that the water reaches the roots of the hair.

5.    Then wash the body, making sure that the water reaches all parts, starting with the right side of the body and then the left, and rubbing it with the hands so that the water reaches the entire body.

> ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did ghusl for janaabah, he would wash his hands and do wudu as for prayer, then he would wash himself, then he would run his fingers through his hair, then when he thought that it [the water] had reached his skin, he would pour water over it [the head] three times, then he would wash the rest of his body. (Narrated by al-Bukhari (248) and Muslim (316))

‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did ghusl from janabah, he would call for something like a vessel used for milking and take water in his palm. He started with the right side of his head, then the left, then he took water in both palms and poured it all over his head. (Narrated by al-Bukhari (258) and Muslim (318))
