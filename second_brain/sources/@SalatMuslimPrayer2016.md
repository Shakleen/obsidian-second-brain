The Holy Prophet  sa  has said:  When you prostrate before God, you should place  your limbs on the ground in the correct manner. In  no way should you spread your arms on the ground  like the front legs of a dog when it sits. (Musnad  Ahmad bin Hanbal, vol. III, p.279; Al-MaktabahIslami, Tab‘a wan-Nashr, Beirut..)

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Every Muslim is required to offer the Fard part of his Prayers in congregation. Mosques are built for the purpose of congregational Prayers. A Hadith tells us that the reward of a Prayer offered in congregation is twenty-seven times more than that offered individually.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> If, at the prescribed time for any Prayer, two or

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> more men are present away from a mosque, they are required to observe the prayer in congregation.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> When only two males come together for Prayers, one of them should lead the Prayer. They should stand together so that the 2nd person stands on the right side of the Imam.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> If a man performs his Prayer at home and a female member of the family like to join him, then, she should stand on his left.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> In the case where two men are already offering their prayer in congregation, and worshippers arrive, they should arrange themselves in a row so that the Imam remains in the middle

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> The worshippers in the front row are rewarded more than the worshippers in the back row,

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> according to a Saying of the Holy Prophetsa. The reason is that those who come early, continue remembering God Almighty while they wait for the Prayer to commence; naturally they are in communion with Allah during more time as compared to the people who come later.

> If the Prayer has already started, the latecomer should join in the congregation in the position in which he finds them.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Once the congregational Prayer has begun, one should not commence with Sunnat and Nafl Prayer. If someone is already engaged in Sunnat Prayer when the Imam starts the Prayer, and he finds himself in the middle of a row formed for the congregational Prayer, he should terminate his Prayer immediately and join in the congregation. If he is offering his Sunnat or Nafl Prayer away from the Prayer Service and he thinks that he can join in the congregation without losing much of the first

> Out of respect for their chastity and honour, women are not advised to stand for Prayer in front of men.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> It is preferable however, to have a separate enclosure for women. It also follows from the above that a woman cannot lead a congregation of men, but can lead a congregation of women.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> This means that she can lead a congregation consisting of children of either sex among the worshippers, but not adult men.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> The female Imam stands in the middle of the first row, according to common practice, and not ahead of the congregation as in the case of a male Imam.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> If the mistake is an incorrect recitation of the Holy Quran, or the Imam has forgotten a verse of the Holy Quran, anyone in the congregation who clearly remembers the correct wording, should

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> remind the Imam by reciting the correct verse in a clear and audible voice.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> f the Imam commits any other mistake, a member of the congregation should draw his attention to it by saying Subhanallah. Subhanallah means 'Allah is free from all faults.' It gives a cue to the Imam that he may have committed a mistake.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> If he does not correct his error, the congregation has to follow him and no one has the right to differ with him during the Prayer. They must follow the Imam even in his mistake.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Then he should lead the congregation to two additional Prostrations by way of condoning the mistake before turning his face to right and left and again repeating  Assalamu ‘Alaikum wa Rahmatullah.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> f a woman wants to draw the attention of the Imam to a mistake which he had committed, she is not allowed to say Subhanallah aloud; instead, she should clap her hands. The sound of clapping from women conveys to the Imam the message that he has committed a mistake.

> And when you have finished the Prayer, remember  Allah.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> t is sinful to leave out a Fard Prayer intentionally, but if such a Prayer is missed through forgetfulness or due to unavoidable circumstances,

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>

> Two Rak‘at offered while performing the Tawaf of  the Ka‘bah.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> It is preferable to recite Surah Al-A‘la, Surah Al-Kafirun and Surah Al-Ikhlas respectively in these Rak‘at. However, this is not necessary. Any Surah or verses of the Holy Quran can be recited.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Offering Sunnat Prayers is considered to be necessary by all jurists. The wilful neglect of Sunnat Prayers is censurable in the sight of Allah.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> However, Nawafil should not be offered during the forbidden times for Prayers. For example, they should not be offered between ‘Asr Prayer and Maghrib Prayer. It is preferable to offer Nawafil Prayers at home rather than in a mosque except for those which have been mentioned to be offered in a mosque.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Any type of conversation during the sermon is prohibited.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> The Holy Prophetsa of Islam did not approve of a person telling others to refrain from conversation while the Imam is delivering his Sermon. In unavoidable circumstances, a gesture by hand or with a finger can be made to draw the attention of someone to stop talking.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Those which are so essential that without them the Prayer cannot be considered valid, are called Fard, i.e. obligatory, mandatory or compulsory.

> While one is on a journey, the Sunnat part of every Prayer is dropped, with the exception of the Vitr Rak‘at in the ‘Isha’ Prayer and the two Rak‘at Sunnat of the Fajr Prayer

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Moreover, it is also permissible to combine two Prayer services during a journey. Zuhr Prayer can be joined with the ‘Asr Prayer and can both be offered either at the Zuhr Prayer time or at ‘Asr Prayer time.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Similarly the ‘Isha’ Prayer can be joined with the Maghrib Prayer and can be offered either at Maghrib Prayer time or ‘Isha’ Prayer time.

> If travellers are offering their congregational Prayer behind an Imam who is a local inhabitant, they have to follow the Imam and offer four Rak‘at for Zuhr, ‘Asr and ‘Isha’ Prayers. The rule of concession would not apply in that case.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> But if the person leading the Prayer, i.e. the Imam, is a traveller, then he will shorten his Prayer accordingly and the travellers in the congregation will also finish their Prayer with the Imam

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> Some religious leaders have given decrees that one may offer one substitute Prayer to compensate all Prayers missed in one’s lifetime. They have coined the term Qada’i ‘Umri for it. Because of such teachings people have become less attentive in the observance of Prayers.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> It, therefore, demeans the institution of Prayer to suggest that a person may neglect the duty of offering Prayer all his life and then simply offer Qada’i ‘Umri one day to compensate the  loss. This is not the teaching of the Holy Prophetsa of Islam.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> According to Islamic jurisprudence, if someone has missed a Prayer knowingly and deliberately, no Qada can compensate that and the Prayer is lost for ever, but the true judge in such cases is God Almighty.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Although it is not obligatory, it is very strongly emphasised by the Holy Quran.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Tahajjud Prayer  consists of eight Rak‘at

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> The Holy Prophetsa always offered Tahajjud Prayer, dividing it into two Rak‘at units.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> His Tahajjud Prayer was followed by three Rak‘at of Vitr Prayer. Thus he used to offer eleven Rak‘at every night before dawn

<mark style="background-color: #2ea8e5">Quote</mark>
> It is in fact offered at Tahajjud time

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> However, it is preferable to offer this Prayer in pre-dawn hours

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Taravih Prayer consists of eight Rak‘at, but one can offer as many as twenty or more Rak‘at if one wants to.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> It seems appropriate to take a little rest each time after offering four Rak‘at.
