> Muslim (479) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “and as for prostrating, strive in Du`a, for it is deserving of a response (from your Lord).”

> Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

“Then he should rise from prostration and say, “Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me),” as the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do. And it is recommended to say along with that: “Allahumma aghfir li wa’rhamni wa’hdini wa’jburni wa’rzuqni wa ‘afini (O Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, console me, grant me provision and grant me well being),” because it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say that.

> The reason why he may say whatever Du`a he can is that the Sunnah is two things: the first is saying Du`a and the second is the specific wording.
