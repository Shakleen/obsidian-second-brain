> Fiqh means understanding-specifically, understanding the rulings of Islam. It helps us distinguish between what is obligatory, what is allowed, and what is forbidden.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> Evidence: If the Quran or Hadith mentions a direct command or punishment for neglecting an act, it is Fard.

> Examples:

Sunnah prayers
Saying Bismillah before eating
Visiting the sick
Fasting on Mondays and Thursdays

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> However, completely abandoning these acts while claiming to love Allah can be a sign of hypocrisy. These acts strengthen our fard acts and build spiritual resilience.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> These are actions that are neither encouraged nor discouraged. You're free to do them or leave them-no reward or punishment is attached.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Examples:

Choosing your clothing style (as long as it follows modesty guidelines)
Eating around a table vs. sitting on the floor
Having hobbies or personal routines

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Makruh actions are disliked but not sinful unless constantly practiced or associated with bad intentions.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Examples:

Eating garlic before going to the mosque
Praying while needing the toilet
Wasting water during wudu

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> These are severe actions that carry major consequences, sometimes even legal punishments in Islamic law.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Examples:

Shirk (associating partners with Allah)
Theft
Murder
Riba (usury)
Zina (fornication/adultery)

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Major sins require true repentance, increased worship, and possibly returning rights to others (like stolen property).

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Minor sins are wrongdoings that can be forgiven through:

Wudu (ablution)
Salah (prayer)
Doing good deeds
Saying prescribed adhkar (remembrances)

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> However, consistent repetition of minor sins without repentance can eventually elevate them to major sins, especially if done shamelessly or with pride.
