> 1 – Obligatory parts of wudu, which are as follows: 

1.      Washing the face completely once, which includes rinsing the mouth and nose.

2.      Washing the arms up to the elbows , once.

3.      Wiping the entire head , including the ears.

4.      Washing the feet up to the ankles, once .

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> This must be done in order, so one washes the face first, then the arms, then wipes the head, then washes the feet, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did wudu in this order.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> This must be done continuously, i.e., the parts of the body must be washed one after the other with no lengthy interruption between washing one part and the next.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> “O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of Janabah (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful” [al-Maidah 5:6]

> 5.      You should wash your face three times, from the hairline to the jawbone and chin, and from ear to ear. A man should wash the hair of his beard because it is part of the face. If his beard is thin he has to wash it inside and out, and if it is thick and covers the skin, he should wash the surface of it only and run his wet fingers through it.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>

> “There is no one among you who does wudu and does it properly and does it well, then he says, ‘Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu,’ but the gates of Paradise will be opened to him and he may enter through whichever of them he wishes.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Taharah, 345)
