> Siwak means cleaning the mouth and teeth with a siwak which is the name given to the tool used.

<mark style="background-color: #5fb236">Quote</mark>
> Siwak is a method of cleaning the mouth which also earns the pleasure of Allah

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Were it not for the fact that I did not want to make things too hard for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every time of prayer. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/299 and Muslim, 1/151)

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> According to another report narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: at every time of making wudu.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> When he entered his house, the first thing he would do was to use the siwak. (Reported by Muslim, 1/220)

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Siwak is cleansing for the mouth, which means that it should definitely be used when the mouth needs cleaning.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> The correct view is that it is sunnah for one who is fasting, just as it is for anyone else, because of the general sense of the reports which prove that it is sunnah.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make any exceptions or state any specific time, and a statement that is general in nature should continue to be taken as general unless there is evidence to indicate that it is specific in application.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> All the scholars are agreed that it is permissible for a fasting person to use siwak early in the day. This shows that use of siwak is encouraged even when fasting, and there is no difference between using it early in the day or later on.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> The correct view is that any kind of sticks that are cleansing and not harmful may be used instead of siwak, if it is not available, to clean the mouth and remove dirt from the teeth. This includes modern toothbrushes which are known to be beneficial in this regard.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> The scholars have stated that it is forbidden to use poisonous sticks, things that are not pure and anything that may cause bleeding, illness or any other harm.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Some scholars have said that when a person is using siwak with the intention of following the sunnah, he should use his right hand, and if he is doing it to remove dirt, he should use his left hand. The fact of the matter is that this issue is open, as there is no definitive evidence or report, and every opinion has a valid point.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> That a person should not use the siwak in front of others or in public

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> That the siwak should be washed after use, to get rid of any dirt that may be on it. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use siwak, then he would give it to me to wash it. I would use it first, then wash it and give it back to him. (Reported by Abu Dawud, 1/45).

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> The siwak should be kept in a clean place.

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> The correct view is that using the fingers cannot be considered as a substitute for the sunnah action, because there is no basis in Islam for doing so, and this method does not clean the mouth as a siwak or similar instrument does

<mark style="background-color: #ff6666">Quote</mark>
> But a person who is fasting should avoid using any flavoured siwak, and should only use natural siwak when he is fasting.
