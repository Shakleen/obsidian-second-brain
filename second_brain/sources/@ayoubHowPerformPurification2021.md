> If you are bathing on a platform or a stool where the water is rapidly flowing, then you need to perform the Wudu completely. But, if it feels like your feet will get dipped in the water, then wash them after you are through with the bath.

> In times of extreme darkness, fear and storms
To wear new clothes
Upon recovering from unconsciousness or regretting a sin
For gathering blessings
Before Tawaaf for Umrah
To stay in Muzdalifah and Arafat
When visiting the Holy Prophet and for the three days when the Hajis throw stones at the devil during Muslim’s pilgrimage to Mecca
