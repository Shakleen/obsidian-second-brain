> The Hanafi school considers Sunnah Muakkadah nearly obligatory - habitual neglect may be sinful - while the other Sunni schools (Shafi‘i, Maliki, Hanbali) also emphasize these practices but do not consider omission sinful, viewing them as highly recommended rather than near-mandatory.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> The Prophet ﷺ never abandoned the Sunnah of Fajr or Witr, even while travelling.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> This is perhaps the most emphasized of the sunnah prayers. The Prophet never left the two raka’ahs Sunnah of Fajr, even when traveling.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> In a hadith, Umm Habiba (RA) narrates that the Prophet promised a great reward for those who uphold all these daily sunnah prayers: “Whoever prays twelve rak‘ahs (of Sunnah) in a day besides the obligatory prayers, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise” . These twelve include the Sunnah of Dhuhr among others.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> In fact, the Hanafi madhab classifies Witr as wajib (required) due to the imperative tone of certain hadiths about it.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) never abandoned Witr prayer; authentic hadiths indicate that he did not neglect the night prayer or Witr, nor the two rak’ahs before Fajr, whether at home or during travel .

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Witr is the closing prayer of the night, and the Prophet advised, “Make your last prayer at night Witr”

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> The Adhan (call to prayer) and Iqamah (call right before congregational prayer) are considered Sunnah Muakkadah for the one leading prayers.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Praying the fard salah in congregation (jama’ah), especially for men, is also deemed a confirmed Sunnah in the Hanafi school  – the Prophet (ﷺ) almost never missed congregational prayer.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Certain aspects of purification are emphasized Sunnah, such as using the miswak (tooth-stick) for oral hygiene and washing each limb three times in wudu (ablution) as the Prophet consistently did.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> In Islamic terminology, Sunnah refers to the traditions and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Sunnah Mu’akkadah, literally “confirmed” or “emphasized Sunnah”, refers to those practices which the Prophet continuously performed and almost never abandoned.

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>
> Importantly, Sunnah Muakkadah carries a strong emphasis. In the Hanafi school, these practices are given such weight that neglecting them without a valid excuse is considered blameworthy and can even be sinful if done habitually.
