I am applying to PhD program in Computer Science in the field of AI, specifically in NLP. I am applying to the following universities: # PhD shortlist universities ## California 1. UC Irvine 2. UC Riverside 3. UC Merced 4. UC San Diego 5. UCLA 6. UC Berkley 7. UC Davis 8. UC Santa Barbara ## Texas 1. UT Austin 2. UT Dallas ## Arizona Arizona State University ## New York 1. New York University  2. University of Rochester ## Others Purdue University Georgia Institute of Technology University of Colorado Bouldar I want to know the acceptance rates for these universities. Please search online and give me a rough estimate. If you can't find acceptance rates for the CS program, a general acceptance rate is also acceptable. Output a table that lists the name of the university and the rate only. Do not output any other text.

Let me search for the remaining universities I need information on.

Based on my searches, I was unable to find specific PhD CS acceptance rates for many of these universities. Most schools don't publicly publish their PhD acceptance rates for specific programs. Let me provide you with the information I could gather:
