I saw an episode from Andrew Huberman on oral care. In it he recommended that we brush our teeth at least once a day, preferably twice (morning & evening), floss daily, and use salty warm water to rinse our mouth after we eat. He discouraged the use of mouth wash stating that mouth wash wasn't effective and might actually cause harm.

I want you to look at multiple research papers and determine if this checks out.

I'll search for research on these oral care recommendations to verify what the evidence says.

Based on my review of multiple research papers, here's what the evidence says about Andrew Huberman's oral care recommendations:

## **Brushing Twice Daily** ✅ **SUPPORTED**

Research shows consensus that tooth brushing twice per day is effective in maintaining oral health and has been shown to prevent caries and periodontal diseases [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16355646/). A meta-analysis found that infrequent brushers demonstrated higher incidence and increment of carious lesions than frequent brushers [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27334438/). Studies show that twice daily fluoride toothbrushing accounts for a 14% reduction in dental caries compared to once a day [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4210365/).

## **Daily Flossing** ⚠️ **MIXED EVIDENCE**

The flossing evidence is more complicated. A Cochrane review found very low certainty of evidence for the efficacy of flossing as an adjunct to toothbrushing to reduce gingivitis [Adha](https://jdh.adha.org/content/96/3/8). However, a five-year study of older adults found that flossers showed significantly less periodontal disease, fewer dental caries, and lost fewer teeth compared to non-flossers [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7375740/).

A Tufts study found that people who learned and consistently used proper flossing technique showed a 70% reduction in bleeding gums after eight weeks, compared to 30% for the control group [Tufts Now](https://now.tufts.edu/2023/09/19/you-could-be-flossing-all-wrong-if-youre-even-flossing-all). The key appears to be **proper technique** and consistency, which most people don't achieve.

## **Salt Water Rinsing After Eating** ✅ **SUPPORTED (with caveats)**

Studies found that salt water effectively reduced plaque and can serve as an adjunct to routine mechanical plaque control for the prevention of oral disease [Colgate](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/mouth-sores-and-infections/how-salt-water-mouth-rinse-benefits-oral-health). Research provides scientific evidence that salt solution as mouth-rinse promotes oral wound healing by stimulating gingival fibroblast cell migration [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4956236/). A study found salt water was as effective as chlorhexidine in reducing dental plaque [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28914244/).

## **Discouraging Mouthwash** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**

This is where Huberman's advice has the most scientific backing, though it's nuanced:

**Concerns about mouthwash:**

- Recent evidence suggests that mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine may cause dysbiosis, whereby certain species of bacteria are killed, leaving others, sometimes unwanted, to predominate [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653923004550)
- Studies found that alcohol-based mouthwash showed an increase of opportunistic bacteria that can increase bacteria associated with periodontal disease, esophageal and colorectal cancer, and systemic diseases [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/alcohol-based-mouthwash-may-disrupt-oral-microbiome-leading-to-gum-disease-and-certain-cancers)
- Chlorhexidine mouthwash was responsible for increasing the presence of bacteria in the intestine involved in various pathological conditions [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54068-y)
- Research linked chlorhexidine mouthwashes to diabetes and high blood pressure, and some mouthwashes have low pH which can lead to erosion [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0036-x)

**However:**

- Chlorhexidine mouthwash shows high-certainty evidence of large reductions in dental plaque when used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10690548/)
- Researchers view that mouthwashes may not be of much value in those with good periodontal health or low caries risk [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653923004562)

## **Conclusion**

Huberman's advice is **largely supported by research**, with important nuances:

1. **Brushing twice daily**: Strongly supported
2. **Flossing daily**: Evidence is weaker than commonly believed, but proper technique matters significantly
3. **Salt water after eating**: Supported as a beneficial adjunct
4. **Avoiding mouthwash**: Supported for people with good oral health, though mouthwashes can be beneficial for specific clinical situations (post-surgery, high caries risk, periodontal disease)

The biggest concern with mouthwash is disruption of the oral microbiome, particularly with chlorhexidine and alcohol-based products. For healthy individuals with good oral hygiene, daily mouthwash use appears unnecessary and potentially harmful.

What other practices are highly recommended by research, dentists, and practitioners?

Based on my comprehensive search through multiple research papers and dental guidelines, here are the other highly recommended oral care practices beyond what Andrew Huberman mentioned:

## **1\. Use Fluoride Toothpaste** ✅ **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**

Fluoride toothpaste is one of dentistry's key strategies to prevent dental caries, with WHO guidance recommending twice-daily toothbrushing with fluoride-containing toothpaste (1000 to 1500 ppm) for children and adults [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16355646/)[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18853203/). Studies found that children aged 5 to 16 years who used a fluoridated toothpaste had fewer decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth after three years, regardless of whether their drinking water was fluoridated [Anticancer Research](https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/39/8/4415). All dental experts recommend using a toothpaste made with fluoride, and no ADA-approved toothpastes are fluoride-free [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653920319432).

## **2\. Limit Sugar Intake** ✅ **CRITICAL**

WHO recommends that intake of free sugars should provide ≤10% of energy intake and suggests further reductions to <5% of energy to protect dental health throughout life [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/salt-water-rinse). There is a clear relationship between sugars consumption and dental caries - plaque forms on the tooth surface and converts free sugars into acids that destroy the tooth over time [Colgate](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/mouth-sores-and-infections/how-salt-water-mouth-rinse-benefits-oral-health). Consuming sugars as part of meals rather than between meals may reduce the risk of caries [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667147622000231).

## **3\. Tongue Cleaning** ✅ **BENEFICIAL**

Research found that using a tongue scraper twice a day for seven days reduced the overall incidence of cavity-causing bacteria in the mouth, and scraping was more effective than brushing at removing odor-causing bacteria [Adha](https://jdh.adha.org/content/96/3/8). Studies showed that tongue scraping and tongue brushing groups showed statistically significant reductions in plaque levels after 10 days and also after 21 days [UCLA Health](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/ask-the-doctors-do-i-need-to-floss). However, there is no evidence to show that using a tongue scraper prevents bad breath long-term [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653923004550).

## **4\. Regular Dental Checkups** ✅ **RECOMMENDED (Risk-Based)**

The evidence on dental visit frequency is nuanced:

Research found little to no difference between six-monthly and risk-based checkups in adults for tooth decay, gum disease and well-being, and longer intervals up to 24 months between checkups may not negatively affect these outcomes [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6516798/). Longitudinal studies showed that routine attenders had better self-reported oral health and less tooth loss and caries by age 32 [Ohio State University-Health Sciences Library](https://hslguides.osu.edu/dental-hygiene/ebp).

**The key takeaway:** The recommendation is for check-up intervals based on each person's individual risk of oral disease, ranging from every three months to every two years for adults [PermaDent](https://permadent.com/patient-education/oral-hygiene-best-practices/). Most people can safely extend beyond the traditional 6-month interval if they're at low risk.

## **5\. Drink Fluoridated Water** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

Studies have shown that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay by about 25% in children and adults alike [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-many-times-a-day-should-you-brush-your-teeth). Fluoridated water keeps a low level of fluoride in the mouth throughout the day, while fluoride toothpaste delivers higher concentrations at important times [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27334438/).

## **6\. Avoid Tobacco** ✅ **CRITICAL**

Smoking increases your chance of gum disease, and if you smoke and want to quit, there are many resources to help you [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0036-x).

## **7\. Electric vs. Manual Toothbrushes** ⚠️ **MIXED EVIDENCE**

Results showed that electric toothbrushes do not significantly outperform manual ones in preventing cavities, though they may reduce plaque [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653923004550). The choice comes down to personal preference and proper technique.

## **Summary of Evidence-Based Oral Care**

The **gold standard routine** according to research includes:

1. Brush twice daily for 2 minutes with fluoride toothpaste (1000-1500 ppm)
2. Clean between teeth daily (floss or interdental cleaners)
3. Limit free sugar intake to <10% of energy (ideally <5%)
4. Consider tongue cleaning for additional bacteria reduction
5. Use salt water rinses after eating
6. Regular risk-based dental visits (not necessarily every 6 months)
7. Drink fluoridated water when available
8. Avoid tobacco and excessive alcohol

The research confirms that **fluoride toothpaste and sugar reduction** are the two most evidence-backed interventions, even more so than the frequency of brushing alone.
