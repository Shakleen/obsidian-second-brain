##### You said:

I am going to start phd next year in the field of computer science and AI. I want to become one of the top 0.1% of researchers Recommend me some books and articles that will help me. I am not looking for books on CS or AI theoretical knowledge. I am looking more for how to do the PhD well.

###### ChatGPT said:

Great to hear you’re aiming so high — striving for the top 0.1% of researchers is an ambitious and inspiring goal! Since you asked for guidance *about* doing a PhD and building a top-tier research career (rather than the technical/AI content itself), here are **recommended books** and **articles**/papers you should absolutely keep on your radar — plus some commentary on what makes them especially useful in the context of a PhD in CS/AI.

## 📚 Recommended Books

Here are five excellent ones that cover the process, mindset, career strategies, writing, and well‐being of research.

1. Mastering Your PhD: Survival and Success in the Doctoral Years and Beyond by Patricia Gosling & Bart Noordam (2022)
	- A clear guide aimed at the entire PhD journey: choosing a research group, setting goals, dealing with setbacks, planning for the future. [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-11417-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Particularly useful because it speaks to STEM/engineering contexts (so relevant for CS/AI).
	- Use it early (when you pick your group/topic) and periodically (when you hit hurdles).
2. How to Be a Researcher: A Strategic Guide for Academic Success by Jonathan Evans (2016)
	- Focuses less on methodology and more on *how to behave*, how to pick topics, read deeply, collaborate, publish, and navigate academia’s politics. [Routledge](https://www.routledge.com/How-to-Be-a-Researcher-A-strategic-guide-for-academic-success/Evans/p/book/9781138917316?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Good for thinking through “Which problems should I chase?” and “How do I build a research identity?”
3. Writing Well and Being Well for Your PhD and Beyond: How to Cultivate a Strong and Sustainable Writing Practice for Life by Katherine Firth (2024)
	- Addresses both the craft of writing (papers, thesis) *and* the often‐neglected side of wellbeing: avoiding burnout, maintaining writing momentum, sustaining a career. [Routledge](https://www.routledge.com/Writing-Well-and-Being-Well-for-Your-PhD-and-Beyond-How-to-Cultivate-a-Strong-and-Sustainable-Writing-Practice-for-Life/Firth/p/book/9781032310817?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- High‐value because many top researchers emphasise the importance of consistent productivity over sporadic bursts.
4. How to Get a PhD: A Handbook for Students and Their Supervisors (various editions, e.g., by Gavin Brown)
	- A focused handbook for doctoral students, with practical tips: managing supervisor relationships, staying motivated, writing up. One reader on Reddit said:
		> “It really articulates well what kind of motivation you need and the skills you will develop, down to how to manage your supervisors and how to clarify your writing intent.” [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/msjorj/how_to_get_your_phd_a_book_i_would_actually/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Good early on—especially in your first year.
5. How to Be a Successful Academic Researcher: Reflections and Tips from a Veteran Social Science Researcher by Jim Macnamara (2024)
	- Although oriented initially at social sciences, many of its lessons apply broadly: building a niche, writing/publishing, making impact, researcher identity. [Elgar+2Google Books+2](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/how-to-be-a-successful-academic-researcher-9781035374021.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqxUjCrMYqEluI5P-vmPs0sNjT-e88hyu0Gv7zpr0VE2-ZZaSmj&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Useful when thinking beyond the PhD: “What kind of researcher do I want to become?”

## 📝 Selected Articles & Papers

Since you’re aiming *top 0.1%*, it helps to think about research culture, impact, collaboration and what separates “good” from “outstanding”. Here are some important reads.

- Scientific Utopia: II. Restructuring Incentives and Practices to Promote Truth over Publishability by Brian A. Nosek et al. (2012)
	- Discusses how academic incentives often push novel and positive results over rigorous / reproducible research. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4251?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- For you: a reminder that *quality*, integrity, and long‐term thinking matter more than just “publish many papers”.
- Quality versus quantity in scientific impact by Jasleen Kaur et al. (2014)
	- Examines how research impact is not simply volume of output; quality matters, especially when building a strong reputation. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7357?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- For you: aiming for “top 0.1%” means thinking about *distinctive value*, not just incremental papers.
- Genealogy tree: understanding academic lineage of authors via algorithmic and visual analysis by Anil et al. (2018)
	- Explores the academic network, lineage, collaboration, citation patterns. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02352?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	- Useful to reflect on: your network, choosing collaborators, aligning with strong groups.

## 🎯 How to Use These Resources (and other strategies)

Here are some tips to get maximal value from the above + to build your “top-tier researcher” pipeline.

- **Start early with mental framing**: Read the “general strategy” books (Gosling & Noordam; Evans) *before* you dive deep into your PhD. It helps to start with the end in mind: what kind of researcher you want to become.
- **Set clear goals at multiple horizons**:
	- Year 1: Choose topic, get up to speed, build literature familiarity, find a good mentor/supervisor.
	- Mid‐PhD: Publish at least 1–2 good papers in good venues (for CS/AI: top conferences/journals).
	- By completion: Build your network, maybe a few collaborations, and a clear story of contribution.
- **Choose your research group / supervisor wisely**: The fit matters. Strong groups help you learn, publish, collaborate, gain visibility. The “Mastering Your PhD” book has good sections on this. [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-11417-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Develop a writing habit & pipeline**: Use Katherine Firth’s book for sustainable writing. Regular writing (even small) beats big bursts. Consistent output = better practice + better visibility.
- **Focus on *impact* not just output**: The “quality vs quantity” article reminds us: publishing many papers is less important than publishing meaningful ones. Go for problems that can matter, that excite you.
- **Be strategic about collaborations & network**: Don’t isolate yourself. Build connections, go to conferences, present early, ask for feedback. The “genealogy tree” paper underscores network dynamics.
- **Manage your wellbeing**: A PhD is a marathon. The writing/being‐well book reminds us that burnout, imposter syndrome, stress are real. Prioritize rest, routines, balance.
- **Think long‐term**: True “top 0.1%” status rarely comes from only the PhD. It’s a foundation. Think: What after PhD? What research agenda will you carry forward?
- **Read about research practices / incentives**: The “Scientific Utopia” paper shows how academic incentives can misalign with “doing great work”. Be aware of the system, so you can navigate it intelligently.
- **Reflect frequently**: At least every 3–6 months, ask yourself:
	- “What have I learned?”
	- “What progress have I made on publication/collaboration?”
	- “What next 3–6 months will I aim for?”

If you like, I can **compile a longer list** (10-15 books + 10-15 key articles) specifically tailored for CS/AI PhD students (with some that highlight conference publishing strategy, open science in AI, becoming visible in the AI community). Would you like that?
