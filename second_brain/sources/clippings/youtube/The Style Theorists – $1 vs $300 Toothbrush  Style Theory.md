## Summary
1. Toothbrush doesn't matter as much as technique. Learn how to use your toothbrush properly.
2. The Oral-B Manual toothbrush is the best bang for the buck. However, it really damages the gums, as the bristles are really hard.
3. Regardless of what brush you use, flossing is still necessary to clean in between teeth.
