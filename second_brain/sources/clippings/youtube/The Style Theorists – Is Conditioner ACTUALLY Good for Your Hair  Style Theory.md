1. Purpose
	   - Shampoo
		     - Cleans hair of dirt
		     - Strips oils
	   - Conditioner
		     - Promotes hair moisture at the root (scalp)
		     - Causes that weird oily greasy feel for shorter hair.
	   - Oil
		     - Locks in moisture
		     - Attracts and sticks dirt and dust
2. Routine

	2. Rinse shampoo and then apply conditioner *(Ideally with cold water)*
	3. Dry off and apply oil
