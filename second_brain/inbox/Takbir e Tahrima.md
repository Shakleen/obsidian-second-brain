## Meaning
* **Takbir** begins the Salah 
* **Tahrima** comes from the word **Haram**.
* This is called **Takbir-e-Tahrima** because with this Takbir, all worldly thinking becomes prohibited until the [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salat]] is complete.

## Process
* Begins the prayer or salah. 
* Raise your hands upto your ears or shoulders and say "Allahu akbar"
  > اللهُ أَكْبَرُ
  > Allah is the Greatest.
* Lower hands down and place right hand on top of left.
    - The exact position is highly debated. However, it's not important.
    - A good rule of thumb is to place your hands 
        - close to your belly button (for males)
        - on top of your chest (for females)
* Fix your gaze to the place where your head will meet the ground during [[Shijda]]
    - Focus and fix your gaze to this position.
    - It's considered bad practice to look around or up and down during salah.
    - Concentrate and try to minimize worldly thinking as much as possible.
    - According to Bukhari,
        > looking here and there is a snatching away which the devil steals from the slave during prayer.
    - According to Hadis described in Ahmad,
        > The Prophet (SA) said, Allah forbade three things:
        >   1. Pecking like a hen
        >   2. Squating like a dog and 
        >   3. Looking around like a fox
