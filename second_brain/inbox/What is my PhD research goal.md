## Ideas generated by LLM Counsel
1. Personalized formative feedback (grok, gemini, chatgpt, claude)
	   - Provide structured feedback and not just a score
	   - Take into account structure, argumentation, logic, domain specific content, etc.
	   - If something is wrong, 
		 - What part is wrong? 
		 - Why is it wrong? 
		 - What's the right answer?
		 - What was the confusion?
2. Personalized learning pathway recommendation (grok, gemini, claude)
	   - Adaptive content curation
	   - Multi-modal GenAI models to generate content personalized to a student
	   - Content as in quizzes, explanations, practice problems, etc.
	   - Generated based on knowledge graph, context, specific knowledge gaps, etc.

## Idea 1: Feedback
**The research outcome is better evaluation. It helps teachers and students evaluate on testing knowledge and learn from mistakes.**

### Concrete Research Questions
1. Can we build models that detect types of misconceptions (not just correctness) and suggest targeted remediation?
2. How to incorporate domain knowledge (curriculum, item templates, solution traces) so models give pedagogically sound diagnoses?
3. Can reasoning-capable models provide compact, verifiable chains-of-thought that map to known misconceptions?
4. How to generate actionable, formative feedback (not just scores) that aligns with learning objectives and pedagogy?
5. How to make feedback interpretable and traceable to student errors (so teachers trust it)?
6. How to evaluate feedback quality (pedagogical usefulness, learning gains) beyond surface metrics?
7. How can you use Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to formally represent the curriculum structure, common student misconceptions, and the prerequisite relationships between concepts? *(More of a combination of [[#Idea 1 Feedback]] and [[#Idea 2 Generation / Recommendation]])*
8. How can NLP models (e.g., Relation Extraction, Text-to-Graph mapping) analyze student work (essays, code, math answers) to link their errors or non-canonical statements directly to a node (misconception) in the Knowledge Graph?
9. Using the KG structure to power a recommendation engine that suggests the optimal intervention (e.g., a specific video, a remedial problem) based on the diagnosed misconception and its prerequisites in the graph. (More of a combination of [[#Idea 1 Feedback]] and [[#Idea 2 Generation / Recommendation]])

## Idea 2: Generation / Recommendation
**The research outcome is better learning content. It helps teachers create better materials, and helps students learn in a way that aligns well with them.**

### Concrete Research Questions
1. How can you use Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to formally represent the curriculum structure, common student misconceptions, and the prerequisite relationships between concepts? *(More of a combination of [[#Idea 1 Feedback]] and [[#Idea 2 Generation / Recommendation]])*
2. Using the KG structure to power a recommendation engine that suggests the optimal intervention (e.g., a specific video, a remedial problem) based on the diagnosed misconception and its prerequisites in the graph. (More of a combination of [[#Idea 1 Feedback]] and [[#Idea 2 Generation / Recommendation]])
3. How can we fine-tune LLMs (or develop smaller, specialized models) to generate high-quality, pedagogically sound, and context-aware educational content (e.g., quizzes, explanations, practice problems) that adapt in real-time to a student's specific knowledge gaps and learning style?
4. Creating new pedagogically-grounded metrics for evaluating the quality, correctness, and educational value of LLM-generated teaching content, going beyond simple perplexity or ROUGE scores.
