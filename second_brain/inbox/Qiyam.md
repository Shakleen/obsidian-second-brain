Qiyam is the part of [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]] where you must stand straight while holding a specific stature described below:
* Stand with your back **straight**.
* After [[Takbir e Tahrima]], lower hands down and place right hand on top of left.
    - The exact position is highly debated. *However, it's not important.*
    - A good rule of thumb is to place your hands 
        - close to your belly button (for males)
        - on top of your chest (for females)
* Fix your gaze to the place where your head will meet the ground during [[Shijda]]
    - Focus and fix your gaze to this position.
    - It's considered bad practice to look around or up and down during [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]].
    - Concentrate and try to minimize worldly thinking as much as possible.
    - According to Hadis described in **Bukhari**,
        > looking here and there is a snatching away which the devil steals from the slave during prayer.
    - According to Hadis described in **Ahmad**,
        > The Prophet (SA) said, Allah forbade three things:
        >   1. Pecking like a hen
        >   2. Squating like a dog and 
        >   3. Looking around like a fox
