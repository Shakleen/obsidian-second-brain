# A graduate school survival guide

## Intro 

* A Ph.D. program is a strange type of job. Initiative, tenacity, flexibility, interpersonal skills, organizational skills, and communication skills are all critical 

* You don’t have to be a genius to do well in graduate school. You must be reasonably intelligent, but after a certain point, I think other traits become more important in determining success.

## Why get a PhD 

* The most basic question every Ph.D. student must know the answer to is: “Why the hell am I doing this?” If you do not have a rock-solid reason for getting the Ph.D., then it is better that you leave with a Master’s.
  
  > "To get into industry as a research engineer."

* With a Ph.D. you will have a better chance of spending the rest of your life doing what you want to do, instead of what someone else wants you to do.”

## Academia is a business

* Academia is a business, and “graduate student” is a job title. Whoever has the gold, makes the rules.

* Most of us needed financial support, in the form of Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships (RA’s). In general, RA’s are more desirable to students since those can directly fund the research you need to finish.

* Where does the money come from? 
  1. Government agencies: NSF, DARPA, etc.
  2. Private companies: NVidia, Google, Microsoft, etc.

* In exchange for the money, organizations want a demonstration of the research being done.

* Who becomes RA?
  1. Dedicated
  2. Capable
  3. Self-motivated
  4. Willing to work for next to nothing in pay

* What happens if the RA fails in research?
  1. The researcher will lose future funds from the organization.
  2. Might stop research from being done at all.

* Tldr
  1. Funding is gathered by professors for their labs.
  2. As an RA, you use those resources to carry out research.
  3. The research must yield results to satisfy the funding organization.
  4. Eventually the professor will fund your research for PhD thesis.
  5. If you fuck up, you don't get RA job. That's basically the end of your PhD career.

## Graduate school is a different ballgame

* Graduate school is not primarily about taking courses. You will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably won’t have any classes. 

* People judge a recently graduated Ph.D. by his or her research, not by his or her class grades.

* Most of what you learn, comes from 
  1. Your own research work 
  2. Conferences 
  3. Collaboration with others

* Success in PhD program comes from doing research and not coursework.

* Carl Vogel suggests the most important personality traits of successful graduate students are being 
  1. inquisitive
  2. disciplined
  3. obsessive and 
  4. delusional (certain that their research programs will uncover something new and important)

## Initiative 

> "The difference between people who exercise initiative and those who don’t is literally the difference between night and day. I’m not talking about a 25 to 50 percent difference in effectiveness; I’m talking about a 5000-plus percent difference, particularly if they are smart, aware, and sensitive to others.”"

* If you never do any tasks except those that your professor specifically tells you to do, then you need to work on initiative. An example of taking initiative:

  > At UNC, there is a famous anecdote about a former UNC graduate student named Joe Capowski. Many years ago, UNC got a pair of force-feedback mechanical arms to use with molecular visualization and docking experiments. The problem was how to move them to UNC. These mechanical arms were large, heavy beasts, and were in Argonne National Labs in Chicago, IL. Unfortunately, there was a trucker’s strike going on at the time. Joe Capowski, on his own initiative (and without telling anyone), flew out to Argonne, rented a truck, drove the mechanical arms all the way back to North Carolina, and then handed the computer science department the bill! Many years later, Joe Capowski ran for the Chapel Hill city council and won a seat. Prof. Fred Brooks gave him an endorsement. I still remember the words Dr. Brooks said: “I may not agree with his politics, but I know he’ll get things done.” (Thanks to Jim Lipscomb for corrections to this anecdote.)

* The more that you have proven that you can work independently and initiate and complete appropriate tasks, the more your professors will leave you alone to do what you want to do.

## Tenacity 

* No one can tell you in advance exactly how long the dissertation will take, so it’s hard to see where the “end of the road” lies. 

* Part of earning a Ph.D. is building a “thick skin” so you are not so fragile that you will give up at the first sign on any difficulties.

* One lesson I learned as a graduate student is the best way to finish the dissertation is to do something every day that gets you closer to being done. If all you have left is writing, then write part of the dissertation every day. If you still have research to do, then do part of it every day.

## Flexibility

* In general, you will be in the position of reacting to big events rather than controlling them. Therefore, you must be flexible in your approach and research program.

* Events can be good as well as bad. The difference between the highly effective graduate student and the average one is that the former recognizes those opportunities and takes advantage of them.

## Interpersonal Skills 

* Your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships

* In both graduate school and in business, you must depend upon and work with other people to achieve your goals.

* Basically, respect other people's time, skill, and effort.
  - Offer to buy coffee or dinner or maybe sport tickets.
  - Work on your own first before asking for someone's help. Collaborate but pull your own weight as much as possible.

* Read *7 Habits of Highly Effective People* Book. Summary can be found here: [[2025-10-22_7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People|7 Habits of Highly Effective People]] 

## Organizational Skills 

> One metaphor I found useful is the following: Organize your tasks as if you were juggling them. Juggling several balls requires planning and skill. You must grab and toss each ball before it hits the ground. You can only toss one ball at a time, just as you can only work on one task at a time. The order in which you toss the balls is crucial, much as the order of working on tasks often determines whether or not you meet all your deadlines. Finally, once you start a task (grab a ball) you want to get enough done so you can ignore it for a while (throw it high enough in the air so it won’t come down for a while). Otherwise you waste too much time in context switches between tasks. Do you see jugglers try to keep each ball at the same height above the ground, frantically touching every ball every second?

## Taking advantage of opportunities 

* How to get something from people of power? **Get noticed in a positive way**.

* If someone does something that shows potential or catches my attention, I am much more willing to invest time in such a person or to steer opportunities his or her way.

* Don’t go around demanding to be mentored or to receive opportunities. Show that you are worth it, make sure that people in positions to grant things are aware of your potential, and when you get opportunities, put in the necessary effort.

## Communication Skills 

* Being able to communicate well is nearly at the top of the list for being successful.

* This skill is learnt through practice. **Attend research luncheons to give informal talks on a paper or subject**.

* Finally, don’t forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates. Keep your committee appraised of your progress. One thing I do (which few others do) is write short (1 screenfull) status reports, which I religiously e-mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis. I also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each week’s report to reward people for reading it.

## Choosing an advisor and a committee 

> Your advisor must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with. The relationship itself can be close or distant.

* Tenured or Non-tenured advisor?
  * Non-tenured 
    - More involved with supervising
    - More time on their hand 
    - Travel less 
    - Typically more hardworking and their ethic formulates the lab culture
    - Not as much funding 
    - Risks leaving the university, leaving you behind
  * Tenured 
    - Way more funding 
    - Way more traveling and connections 
    - More experienced with how the PhD game works

* If circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs, don’t be afraid to switch if that is an overall win.

* When picking a committee, you want to make sure they can cover all areas of your thesis. You also want to make sure that it is likely that all the committee members will be available for meetings!
