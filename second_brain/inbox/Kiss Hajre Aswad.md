Now, without bothering anyone, go in front of [[Hajre Aswad]] and kiss it without making a noise. The process of kissing is to place both hands on it and kiss in the middle of the hands. Make sure not to kiss the silver covering around the [[Hajre Aswad]].
	   - Kissing it 3 times is [[Mustahab]]
	   - After each kiss, keeping your forehead or cheek on it is also [[Mustahab]].
	   - In case you're unable to kiss it due to crowd, touch [[Hajre Aswad]] with your right hand, and then kiss that hand.
	   - If even that's not possible, then imitate you are placing your both hands on [[Hajre Aswad]] and then kiss both hands.
