Now, without bothering anyone, go in front of [[Hajre Aswad]] and kiss it
* In case you're unable to kiss it due to crowd, touch [[Hajre Aswad]] with your right hand, and then kiss that hand.
* If even that's not possible, then imitate you are placing your both hands on [[Hajre Aswad]] and then kiss both hands.

## What to do

2. Kissing it 3 times is [[Mustahab]]
3. After each kiss, keeping your forehead or cheek on it is also [[Mustahab]].

	> Bismillahi allahu akbar.
	> I'm praying for help while I start, in the name of Allah.

## What not to do
1. In any circumstances, you can't harm or even bother anyone.
2. Don't kiss the silver covering around [[Hajre Aswad]].
3. Don't make noise. Kissing should be silent.
