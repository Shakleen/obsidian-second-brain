# Levels of obligations

## Fard (Obligatory)
* **Meaning**: **Absolute obligations** mandated by Allah in the Qur'an or established through undeniable Mutawatir Hadith.
* **Consequence of Omission**: Intentionally omitting a Fard act is a [[Major Sin]].
* Example:
  - 5 daily prayers ([[2025-10-30_Fajr-prayer|Fajr]], [[2025-10-30_Duhr-prayer|Duhr]], [[2025-10-30_Asr-prayer|Asr]], [[2025-10-30_Magrib-prayer|Magrib]], [[2025-10-30_Isha-prayer|Isha]])
  - [[Fasting]] during Ramadan
  - Giving [[Zakat]]
  - etc.

## Wajib (Required)
* **Meaning**: These acts are considered necessary obligations, though their status is slightly below [[#Fard (Obligatory)]].
* **Consequence of Omission**: Intentionally omitting a Wajib act is considered [[Major Sin]].
* Example:
  - Bitr prayer 
  - Eid prayer

## Sunnat-e-Muakkadah (Emphasized Sunnat)
* **Meaning**: These are acts the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) performed persistently and regularly as part of his established practice (Sunnah).
* **Consequence of Omission**: While not equivalent to missing a [[#Fard (Obligatory)]] or [[#Wajib (Required)]], consistently neglecting without a valid excuse is considered [[Makruh Tahrimi]] or sinful by many scholars.
* Example:
  - 2 rakat sunnat prayer before Fard in Fajr 
  - 4 rakat sunnat prayer before Fard in Duhr 
  - etc.

## Sunnat-e-Ghair Muakkadah (Non-Emphasized Sunnat)
* **Meaning**: These are acts the Prophet (PBUH) also practiced, but he did them sometimes and omitted them at other times, indicating they are not a constant requirement of the faith.
* **Consequence of Omission**: There is no sin for omitting these acts, even intentionally.
* Example:
  - 4 rakat sunnat prayer before Fard in Asr 
  - 4 rakat sunnat prayer before Fard in Isha
  - etc.

## Nafl (Voluntary)
* **Meaning**: These are optional, extra acts of worship that go beyond what is required or highly recommended. They are performed purely out of one's desire to seek extra reward and draw closer to Allah.
* **Consequence of Omission**: There is no sin for not performing them.
* Example:
  - [[2025-10-30_Tahajjud-prayer|Tahajjud prayer]]
