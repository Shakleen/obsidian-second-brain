# Nafl

## Level: Optional
**Meaning**: These are optional, extra acts of worship that go beyond what is required or highly recommended. They are performed purely out of one's desire to seek extra reward and draw closer to Allah.

## Consequence of Omission
There is no sin for not performing them.

## Example:
- [[2025-10-30_Tahajjud-prayer|Tahajjud prayer]]
