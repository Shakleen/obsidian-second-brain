## Measuring Sleep Quality ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#A. The Metrics of High-Quality Sleep Sleep Efficiency (SE) and Sleep Latency|Source]])
1. **Sleep Efficiency (SE)** defined as the amount of time actually spent sleeping while in bed, expressed as a percentage.
   - Maximize SE for High Quality sleep
1. **Sleep onset Latency (SOL)** is the length of time required to fall asleep after getting into bed.
   - Minimize SOL

## Important stages of sleep
1. **Deep Sleep (SWS or N3)** ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#N3 (Slow Wave Sleep or SWS)|Source]])
   - 20% of total sleep time
   - Its quantity is driven by the duration and intensity of prior wakefulness
   - **Front loaded**: Meaning mostly happens in early sleep time.
1. **REM Sleep** ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#REM Sleep|Source]])
   - 25% of total sleep time
   - Governed by circadian clock and prior wakefulness
   - **Tail loaded**: Meaning mostly happens in later sleep time.
   - Vital for
	   - Emotional regulation
	   - Cognitive processes
	   - Memory consolidation
1. **Sleep fragmentation and N1 stage** ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#Sleep Fragmentation and Stage N1|Source]])
   - Transition from wakefulness to sleep
   - Affected heavily by
	   - Environmental disturbances
	   - Sleep disorders
	   - Internal factors
   - Must be reduced for high quality sleep

## The Challenge of Sleep Compression
If you sleep less than the recommended **7 hours**, you risk cutting REM sleep stage essential for brain development and maintenance. ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#C. The Challenge of Sleep Compression and Architecture|Source]])
