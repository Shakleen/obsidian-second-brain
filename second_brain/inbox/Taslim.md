This officially ends the [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]]. Said after [[Closing Supplication]]. The following sentences are said, once turning head to the right, and then again turning head to the left.
> Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah
> 
> Peace and mercy of Allah be on you.
## Why
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
> “When saying the Salam, the Imam should intend the first Salam as an exit from the prayer and a greeting to those who are on his right and upon the recording angels, and he should intend the second Salam as a greeting to those on his left and the recording angels. The one who is praying behind him should intend the first Salam as an exit from the prayer and as a greeting to the Imam, the recording angels and the worshippers in his vicinity, in his row and behind him and in front of him, and he should intend the second Salam as a greeting to the worshippers in his vicinity, and if the Imam is in front of him, he should intend his two Salams to be greetings to him too. 
> 
> The one who is praying alone should intend his first Salam as an exit from the prayer and a greeting to the recording angels, and the second Salam as a greeting to the recording angels. The basic principle in his case is that which was narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to send Salams upon ourselves and to greet one another with Salam… 
> 
> If he intends to exit the prayer and does not intend anything else, that is permissible because saying Salam to those who are present is Sunnah.” (End quote from Al-Majmu, 3/456)


## Hadith
> "I saw the Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pronouncing tasleem on his right and on his left, until I saw the whiteness of his cheek." (Muslim: 582)

> "We said our prayer with the Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and, while pronouncing tasleem, we made gestures with our hands [saying]: "Peace be upon you, peace be upon you." The Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked towards us and said: Why is it that you make gestures with your hands like the tails of headstrong horses? When any one of you pronounces salutation (in prayer) he should only turn his face towards his companion and should not make a gesture with his hand." (Muslim: 431)
