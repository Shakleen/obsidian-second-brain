There is no mention of how to perform [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salat]] in the Qur'an. Zibrael (A) appeared before the Prophet (SA) and showed him practically how to perform salat and when to.
## Steps
The following steps should be performed in order (Because doing so is [[Salah Wajibs|Wajib]]).
1. [[Intention of Salat]]
2. [[Takbir e Tahrima]]
3. Get into [[Qiyam]] position and 
	1. Recite [[Sana]]
	2. For the first [[Rakat]], recite [[2025-11-03_Auzubillah|Auzubillah]]
	3. [[Qirat]]
4. Go into [[Ruku]] after [[Takbir]].
	1. Recite [[Ruku Tasbih]] minimum 3 times. (You can say more but the count must be odd)
