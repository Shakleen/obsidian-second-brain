# Ph.D. Students Must Break Away From Undergraduate Mentality

1. Grades don't matter as much. Just keep it above a certain bar.
2. Own your research. Nobody should be telling you to do it.
3. Stand up for yourself and for your research. If you think it's right, fight for it. Use [[2025-10-22_The-Heilmeier-Catechism|The Heilmeier Catechism]] to identify your correctness.
4. Don't ignore the social aspect of PhD. Meet people outside your immediate circle, organize some events, work together, etc.
