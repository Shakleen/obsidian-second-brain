| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **[[Fard]]**                     | **Absolutely Obligatory.** A foundational pillar or commandment from Allah.                           | **[[Major Sin]]** Intentionally omitting it is a grave matter.     | Great reward.                                | The 5 daily obligatory prayers (Salah).                                                  |     |
| **[[Wajib]]**                    | **Required/Necessary.** Very close to _Fard_ but sometimes differentiated by school of thought.       | **Sinful.** Omission is generally treated seriously.            | Reward.                                      | _Witr_ prayer (in the Hanafi school).                                                    |     |
| **[[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah]]**       | **Emphasized Tradition.** Acts the Prophet ($\text{PBUH}$) performed persistently and consistently.   | **Sinful/Highly Disliked** if consistently left without excuse. | Significant reward; completes _Fard_ duties. | The _Sunnah_ prayers accompanying the 5 daily prayers (e.g., 2 _rak'ahs_ before _Fajr_). |     |
| **[[Sunnat-e-Ghair-Muakkadah]]** | **Non-Emphasized Tradition.** Acts the Prophet ($\text{PBUH}$) practiced occasionally but not always. | **No Sin.** Omission is generally overlooked.                   | Reward.                                      | Certain _Sunnah_ prayers associated with _Dhuhr_ or _Asr_.                               |     |
| **[[Nafl]]**                     | **Voluntary/Supererogatory.** Extra acts done purely out of devotion.                                 | **No Sin.** It is optional.                                     | Extra reward; draws one closer to Allah.     | _Tahajjud_ (night prayer) or _Duha_ (mid-morning) prayer.                                |     |
