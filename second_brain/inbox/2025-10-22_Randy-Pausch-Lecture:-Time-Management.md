# Randy Pausch Lecture: Time Management

1. **Think of time as a commodity**: What is your hourly rate? If it's $40 then spending an hour doing something is the same as spending $40.
  > "If you're gonna run with meta people, you gotta find the right ways to optimize the skills that you do have."
2. Doing the right thing is more important than doing things right.
  > Lou Holtz, former football coach, had a list of 100 things he wanted to do. If anything he did, didn't contribute to those 100 things, they were unimportant.
  > Pareto principle: 80/20 rule
3. Covey's 4 quadrant TODO
   ![[Pasted image 20251022190445.png]]
   1. Due soon and important gets done first.
   2. Not due soon but important gets done second.
   3. Due soon but not important can be ignored.
   4. Not due soon and unimportant gets done last.
4. Emails and papers: Either turn it into a TODO, or delete it.
5. Multiple monitors: **I personally disagree with his take**
  1. Multiple monitors mean that you have to search using your eyes.
  2. Searching with your eyes is slow.
  3. Instead have one monitor and multiple workspaces.
  4. Make sure each workspace is a key press away and has a designated purpose.
    * Workspace 1 is for coding
    * Workspace 2 is for browsing
    * Workspace 3 is for music player, etc.
  5. Be intentional with where you want to go and what you want to do. Multiple monitors aren't really a benefit for this.
6. Use a calendar to record and remember events. Use a TODO list to record what you have to do.
7. Have a stack of thank you notes. Then dedicate them to people.
8. **Understand opportunity cost**: Learn to say **No** to unimportant stuff.
9. Ruthlessly protect your deep work times.
10. Schedule important but mundane stuff on dead times.
11. Bound interactions by saying **"I only have 5 minutes"**.
12. Time journaling.
13. If you have gaps between two classes, make up a **"Fake class"** which is basically go to a specific location, and get some work done.
14. Work when you should be working, so you can go home and rest.
