### Controlling Time In Bed (TiB)
To maintain high SE, associate bed (and bedroom) with only sleep related activity. Don't lay on your bed, unless you intend to sleep. ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#B. Step-by-Step Protocol Calculating Time in Bed (TIB)|Source]])

### Mental fatigue
Leave stressful work related activities before sleeping. Plan for the day ahead by creating task lists, journal to reflect on the past day, perform mindfulness exercises.
> [!Error] No work 2 hours prior to bed.

### Ingestion
1. **Caffeine** is a well-known disruptor of sleep and has a prolonged **half-life of five to six hours**. Its use must be strictly managed to protect sleep quality. ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#A. Caffeine’s Long Shadow Effects on Total Sleep Time and SWS|Source]])
   > [!Error] No Caffeine 6 hours before sleeping.
2. **Alcohol** while it does promote sleep, it disrupts the sleeping stages. ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#B. Alcohol’s Biphasic Disruption Fragmented Recovery|Source]])
3. **Food consumption** close to bed time inhibits sleep. ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#C. The Chrono-Nutritional Link Impact of Nocturnal Caloric Intake|Source]])
   > [!Error] No food 3 hours before sleeping

### Environment
1. **Thermal** regulation ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#A. Thermal Regulation and Deep Sleep Stability|Source]])
   - Cool room temp from (15-19 degrees celcius) promotes REM sleep.
   - Take a warm shower **90 minutes** before bed.
1. **Auditory** regulation ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#B. The Acoustic Imperative Noise Abatement|Source]])
   - Reduce noise through sound dampening
   - White noise
1. **Light** regulation ([[Optimize Sleep Quality for Busy Schedules#C. Light Hygiene Mitigating Blue Light Exposure|Source]])
   - Absence of light (especially blue light) triggers melatonin which promotes sleep.
