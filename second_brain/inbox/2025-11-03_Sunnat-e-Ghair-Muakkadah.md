# Sunnat e Ghair Muakkadah

## Level: Non-Emphasized Sunnat
**Meaning**: These are acts the Prophet (PBUH) also practiced, but he did them sometimes and omitted them at other times, indicating they are not a constant requirement of the faith.

## Consequence of Omission
There is no sin for omitting these acts, even intentionally.

## Example:
- 4 rakat sunnat prayer before Fard in Asr 
- 4 rakat sunnat prayer before Fard in Isha
- etc.
