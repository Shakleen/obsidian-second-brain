Silently state the intention of Salah. This means saying what Salah you're about to perform. It doesn't have to be in Arabic. It can be in whatever language you're comfortable with. Here are a few examples:
## Praying Duhr in [[Jamat]]
I'm standing behind this Imam, facing towards the Qibla, to perform 4 Fard rakats of Duhr.
## Praying alone
