> [!Info]- Concrete Answers to the 4 Important Questions
> ## What is your research question? (Changes to fit the university/program)
> 1. **Network or graph focused:** Constructing knowledge graphs that will map misconceptions to learning materials effectively.
> 2. **Recommendation/GenAI:** Generating learning content personalized to the learning style of a user.
> 3. **Continual learning**: How can deep learning models adapt to how a user's knowledge is constantly changing.

> ## Why are you interested in this research? (To make education better)
> I have been an avid user of *Anki* (A spaced repetition software) used to make learning easier and more effective. It has saved me countless hours of re-reading content I have already consumed and helped me remember what I read. During my masters, I participated in multiple Kaggle competitions focused around using NLP to solve education problems like obfuscating PII, evaluating essays based on heuristics, mapping misconceptions to mistakes, etc. These competitions inspired me to build an edtech product to help people study more effectively. This got me started on my startup adventure in late 2024. My idea was to build a learning tool that lowers the friction of saving information a person wants to remember. However, the startup didn't end up doing well because the idea itself didn't attract investor attention. One of the core ideas for my product was quizzing users information they are most likely to forget on any given day and recommend them the sources they needed to review to brush up on the topic. This got me into digging up research that mapped mistakes to learning content, which a knowledge graph does effectively. However, I failed to find much research on the topic. Thus my goal for PhD is to research knowledge graphs that can be used to map misconceptions to learning content.
