> [!Info]- Concrete Answers to the 4 Important Questions
> ## What is your research question? (Changes to fit the university/program)
> 1. **Network or graph focused:** Constructing knowledge graphs that will map misconceptions to learning materials effectively.
> 2. **Recommendation/GenAI:** Generating learning content personalized to the learning style of a user.
> 3. **Continual learning**: How can deep learning models adapt to how a user's knowledge is constantly changing.
>
> ## Why are you interested in this research? (To make education better)
> ### Knowledge Graph for Mapping Mistakes to Topics
> My interest in the intersection of Computer Science and cognitive science stems from my experience as an early adopter of Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) like Anki, which fundamentally demonstrated the power of optimized, efficient learning. This personal engagement led me to pursue a deeper understanding of educational technology during my Master’s, where I participated in several Kaggle competitions focused on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to educational diagnostics, including the automated evaluation of essays and mapping common errors to specific misconceptions.

> This work inspired an entrepreneurial venture to develop a tool that minimized the friction of dynamic retrieval practice by automatically identifying a user's most likely-to-be-forgotten concepts and recommending precise content for review. The challenge was not commercial, but technical: I found a critical academic gap in systems capable of diagnostic reasoning. Specifically, there is a sparse research landscape on developing Knowledge Graph (KG) methodologies that can robustly and automatically map observed user mistakes and misconceptions directly to granular learning content and optimal review schedules.
> 
> Therefore, my PhD goal is to research and develop novel Knowledge Graph architectures and NLP techniques to establish this diagnostic link, bridging the current gap between educational assessment and personalized, content-aware remediation.
