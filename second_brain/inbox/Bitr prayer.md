Same as [[2025-10-30_Isha-prayer#time|Isha prayer time]]

## [[Rakat|Rakats]]
1. 3 [[Rakat|rakat]] of [[Wajib]]

## Special Dua
The [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]] is carried out exactly in [[Salat step-by-step]]. The only difference is in the **3rd [[1762341227-LTQD|rakat]]**:
1. Perform [[Qirat]] as usual.
2. Afterwards, say [[Takbir]] and raise your hands to your ears/shoulders.
3. Then recite [[Dua Qunood]] (It's regarded by many scholars as being [[Wajib]], and by others [[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah]])
4. Then go to [[Ruku]] after saying [[Takbir]] and follow the rest of the [[Salat step-by-step|step-by-step]] guide.
