# From references to fleeting notes: Zotero and Zotero plug ins

I use six ways to import a file and/or reference into Zotero:

1. If I have a physical book, I use this iOS shortcut to save the reference to my Zotero database by scanning the barcode.
2. If I come across a resource online, I import it using the Zotero Connector plug-in;
3. If I have a PDF with embedded metadata, I simply import (i.e. “drag and drop”) the document into Zotero;
4. If I have a PDF but it does not contain metadata, I look up the .bibtex reference on Google Scholar and use the Zotero import from keyboard;
5. If I only have an ISBN or DOI, I use the “Add Item by Identifier” option in Zotero;
6. If none of the above applies, I fill out the metadata manually.
