# How to perform Wudu or Ablution

## What is Wudu 

Wudu is a physical and spiritual act to purify oneself before starting prayer. This purification ritual is a mandatory step which involves washing of the hands, mouth, nostrils, face, arms, head and feet. 

## Why perform Wudu

> “No salah is accepted without wudu (purification)”- Sahih Muslim, Book 2, Hadith 2 

## Steps

### Step 1: Make Intention 
Determine your intention either aloud or silently. There are no words or special statements that need to be said here. Creating the intention is a matter of the heart and mind.

### Step 2: Say Bismillah
Begin in the name of Allah.

### Step 3: Wash hands
* Start with right 3 times, then left hand.
* Water must reach in between fingers and finger nails.

> In hadith book of Muslim and Jami At-Tirmidhi it was said, “and when he washes his hands, every evil he did with his hands leaves with the water – or with the last drop of water – until he becomes free of sin.” [[@abdullaHowWuduStep]]
