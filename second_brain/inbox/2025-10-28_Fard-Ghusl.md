> "Aishah (radyAllaahu anhaa) in Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, in which she said: "When Allah'ss Messenger (sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) would perform ghusl due to Janaabah (sexual impurity), he would begin by washing his hands. Then he would pour water from his right hand to his left and wash his private parts with it (i.e. the left hand). Then he would perform wudoo (ablution). Then he would take water and place his (wet) fingers on the roots off his hair. Then he would pour three handfuls of water over his head. Then he would pour water all over the rest of his body.
