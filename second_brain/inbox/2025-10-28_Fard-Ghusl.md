> "Aishah (radyAllaahu anhaa) in Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, in which she said: "When Allah'ss Messenger (sallAllaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) would perform ghusl due to Janaabah (sexual impurity), he would begin by washing his hands. Then he would pour water from his right hand to his left and wash his private parts with it (i.e. the left hand). Then he would perform wudoo (ablution).
