The part of the [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]] where one must recite verses from the Quran. 
## Parts
1. [[Bismillah]]
2. Recitation of [[Sura Fatiha]]
3. [[Bismillah]]
4. Recitation of one other Sura from the Quran. Must recite at least three [[Ayaat|Ayaats]] from the Quran.
	* This is required for all [[Rakat|Rakats]] of non-[[Fard]] prayers ([[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah]], [[Sunnat-e-Ghair-Muakkadah]], and [[Nafl]] prayers).
	* For [[Fard]] prayers, recitation of additional Suras aren't required for 3rd and 4th [[Rakat|Rakats]].
## Best Practice
1. Recite [[Ayaat|Ayaats]] properly with proper elongation and gaps in between.
2. Recite Sura from which is furthest from [[Sura Fatiha]] to closest. For example, you'd recite [[Sura An-Nisa]] after [[Sura Al-Fil]].
3. Recite [[Sura Fatiha]] before other 
4. *Shortening is permissible* when the moment requires it. According to Hadith from Muslim and Bukhari, Prophet (SA) said,
   > I enter into prayer intending to lengthen it, but I hear the crying of a child, so I shorten my prayer, because I know how deeply his mother feels about his crying.
