The part of the [[2025-10-28_Salat|Salah]] where one must recite verses from the Quran. 
## Parts
1. Recitation of [[Sura Fatiha]]
2. Recitation of one other Sura from the Quran. Must recite at least three [[Ayaat|Ayaats]] from the Quran.
	* This is required for all [[Rakat|Rakats]] of non-[[Fard]] prayers ([[Sunnat-e-Muakkadah]], [[Sunnat-e-Ghair-Muakkadah]], and [[Nafl]] prayers).
	* For [[Fard]] prayers, recitation of additional Suras aren't required for 3rd and 4th [[Rakat|Rakats]].
## Best Practice
1. Recite [[Ayaat|Ayaats]] properly with proper elongation and gaps in between.
2. Recite Sura from which is furthest from [[Sura Fatiha]] to closest. For example, you'd recite [[Sura An-Nisa]] after [[Sura Al-Fil]].
